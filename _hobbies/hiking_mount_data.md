It was 7am in the morning and about 40F outside. We did not expect such a low temperature around this time at Yosemite, so we did not prepare warm clothes except my fall hoodie and my son's yellow rain jacket left unattended in the car. 

I was told the trail was short (6miles round-trip) but the elevation gain was significant (3000ft), which is actually what I would expect for a mountain climbing trail. Even though the outside temperature was low, I thought the sun and the heat we would accumulate during the climb could keep us going and the climb would be quick and relatively easy.

However, what I did not know was the trailhead is actually not the bottom of Mt Dana. We can only start to climb Mt Dana after about 1.5 mile hiking with 1000ft ascending elevation. It was a pleasant hiking till we reached the bottom of the Mt Dana where we faced a critical decision whether we should continue our climb.

Literally, being at the bottom of Mt Data, I felt like we were on Mars. No tree around. Strong wind made the coldness even more unbearable. My daughter said she could no more endure this coldness with just a breathable shirt. Actually I was already impressed she could endure this far.
Looking down the path we had just been through, trying to spot the carpark where we started, and realizing we had spent a significant amount of effort, I did not think we should turn back. I decided to give my hoodie to my daughter so she could proceed with her climb. It also means that I must continue my climb with a cropped short-sleeve t-shirt!

During the Mt Dana climb, I could not recall all the thoughts that wandered in my brain, but I certainly knew giving up was not an option. Instead of looking up to know how far I needed to climb to reach the top, I looked down to the path we had climbed and felt proud of myself. This strategy helped me survive the climb.

It was super windy at the summit but an awe-inspiring view made me feel it's worth all of my effort! In a moment, I even had a thought to climb it again just for this view ðŸ˜…

It's never easy to book a campsite at Yosemite. Before ending this post, I want to share some logistics information for the trip:
* Parking: Free parking at the trailhead
* Yosemite National Park Reservation: Not required. The trailhead is right at the entrance
* Best time to climb Mount Dana: Late August-Sep
* Camping area near Mount Dana: [free lake-front camping area near the trailhead of Mount Dana](https://www.google.com/maps/place/37Â°56'24.8%22N+119Â°14'27.0%22W/@37.9402111,-119.2434055,882m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d37.9402111!4d-119.2408306?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUwNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). We usually camp here when visiting Yosemite from Mammoth via Tioga Rd. However, this road is usually closed during winter.
